- Download the latest release (publish.zip) from https://github.com/saradotramli/ModIo.ModderClient/releases/
- Extract publish.zip into a folder of your choice
- Navigate to the folder where the contents were extracted and run `ModIoModderClient.application`
- When prompted, agree to install the application
- After installation is complete, the application requires your mod.io account's Auth Token to be configured before it can be run
- Using `Windows Search`, search for `ModIoModderClient.exe` and locate the installation folder. This would typically be located a few folders deep within this folder `"C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Apps\"`
- For e.g. `"C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0\NV3Q3QXD.8J4\31NDZH3D.C2D\modi...exe_0000000000000000_0001.0000_none_aae92771ba966b2c"`
- Once you open this folder you'll find a file `"appsettings.json"` at the same level as `"ModIoModderClient.exe"`
- Open `"appsettings.json"` using any text editor and you'll find the mod.io Auth Token to be empty like this `"modioAuthToken": ""`
- Generate an auth token for your account from mod.io. Navigate to https://mod.io/oauth/widget, provide a token name, say `"ModIoModderClientToken"`, select `"Read+Write"`, `"games-306"` and click on `"Create Token"`. Copy and backup this token elsewhere as it cannot be recovered later. Don't be alarmed though, as in case the token is lost, we can always generate a new one.
- Paste the generated token in appsettings.json within the empty quotes. `"modioAuthToken": "<YourAuthTokenFromModIoGoesHere>"`
- Save appsettings.json, close the file and (re)start the app.
- You should see a list of all your mods in a dropdown list.
- Select any mod and click on `"Get Mod Files"` to get a list of files already uploaded for that Mod
- Click on `"Add Files"` button to select and upload new files for the Mod
- Using the `"..."` browse button point to the folder which has all the `.zip` files created by SnowRunner's `Pack Mo`d feature.
- A grid would then list all .zip files found in that folder and tries to guess the platform for which each .zip is built
- The `Version` and `Changelog` details can either be provided at each file level or as a common value for all files being uploaded. If details are provided at both levels, the file level values will take precedence.
- Use the checkboxes in `"Upload?"` column to select the files that have to be uploaded
- Finally when you are ready to upload, click on `"Upload File(s)"` button to begin upload
- The Upload Status column should indicate the status for each file (Pending -> In-Progress -> Uploaded/Failed)
- If the Upload fails due to network being slow, you can bump up the `"httpTimeOutInMins"` value in `appsettings.json` from the default 2 minutes 
- Once the Upload is complete, you can close the Upload Window and the Mod's file list should auto-refresh to show you the latest file list
- You can also choose to delete a mod file using the `"Delete (X)"` button from here. Mod.io will reject deletions for files marked as Active though.
- Please try this tool with a dummy hidden mod and once you find it working fine and to your satisfaction, use it for a live mod.
